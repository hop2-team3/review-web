2023 DEMO PROJECT

For the following 'Demo Day' project our team is working towards making a comprehensive review website that is easy, and suitable for seeing reviews or getting information about the place you are looking for. There are a lot of beneficial aspects for the customers, such as If you are stuck and don't know where to look for the restaurant you want to go to, or if you find insufficient information, you can get information about the place from our website in the fastest way and without wasting time on where to search. We are mainly using React and javascript to write our front-end code and using MongoDB, node js, and express js for the back-end code respectively. 

We are using https://www.trustpilot.com/ as our project sample and design.
